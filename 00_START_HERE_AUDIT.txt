🎯 QUICK SUMMARY (5 MINUTES)
================================================================================

CURRENT RATING: 7.5/10
   ✅ Architecture: Excellent
   ✅ UI/UX: Excellent (recent redesigns outstanding)
   ✅ Features: Good (but missing safety features)
   ⚠️ Safety: Poor (no allergies, interactions, vitals)
   ⚠️ Clinical: Incomplete

TOP 3 CRITICAL ISSUES:
   🔴 No Allergy System - Patient could have reaction
   🔴 No Drug Interactions - Incompatible meds could be prescribed
   🔴 No Vital Signs - Can't monitor physical health

IMPROVEMENT ROADMAP: 4 Phases (8-12 weeks)
   Phase 1 (2 weeks): Safety Features (Allergies, Interactions, Vitals)
   Phase 2 (2 weeks): Clinical Data (Notes, Assessments, Goals)
   Phase 3 (2 weeks): Enhancements (Dashboard, Follow-ups, UI)
   Phase 4 (2 weeks): Analytics (Reports, Insights, Data)

FINAL RESULT: 9.5/10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
   Safe, complete, professional clinic management system
